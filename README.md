# eps-i2c
Arduino code communicates with an EPS via I2C to control and monitor power channels. It sends commands to enable power outputs and reads specific byte data to check system status. The code repeatedly configures the EPS and prints byte values to the serial monitor, allowing efficient power management and real-time monitoring.
